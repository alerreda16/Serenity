						Deaths are an important part of League of Legends, as you continue to play it, you are always going to experience death, and you are going to die a lot. The primary cause of death, in League of Legends and in other video games alike, is the underestimation of your opponent in some form or another. So the aim of this guide is to help teach you some techniques in order to avoid getting into situations which can lead to your death.

						The Principle of Charity:
					</div>
					<div id="quote">
						“In philosophy and rhetoric, the <b>principle of charity</b> requires interpreting a speakers statements to be rational and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.” – Norman Baillargeon
					</div>
					<div class="para2">
						In terms of League of Legends, what the Principle of Charity is saying is that if you are unsure of what your opponent is doing, then just assume they are being smart. For the majority of the time, your opponent will have knowledge of something that you are unaware of; such as oncoming ganks. The biggest tip as well to avoid dying in League is to not be greedy. Greed is one of the biggest factors of death in lower ranks, where players will tend to chase kills, and fall for baits, which lead to their inevitable deaths.
					</div>
					<div class="para2">
						If you follow this principle in order to avoid underestimating your opponent, it is almost assured you will not end up in a situation where you will die; from overextending, or entering an unwarded brush when you have no vision of the enemy team, or what have you. You’ll be able to play safe and back off for a head start during ganks, you won’t overextend as much, and you’ll be able to live through more of these encounters; or avoid them completely.
